## Overview

This privacy policy describes how the Miro browser extension ("we", "our", or "extension") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our educational video auto-play assistant extension.

## Information We Collect

### Automatically Collected Information

### Information We Do NOT Collect

- **Browsing History**: We do not track or store your browsing history outside the supported educational platform
- **Account Information**: We do not access or store login credentials or account information

## How We Use Information

### Local Storage Only
